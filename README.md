# Monty Hall Simulations

By Dafu Ai

My approach simply simulates a large number of trials for either decision (keep or switching choice).

With `sample_run()` function, we receieves the following output:

```
AVERAGE: Winning rate = 0.334 for keeping choice.
AVERAGE: Winning rate = 0.666 for switching choice.
```
