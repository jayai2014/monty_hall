# Monty Hall Simulations

By Dafu Ai

My approach simply simulates a large number of random games for either decision (keep or switching choice).

With the `sample_run()` function in [main.py](https://github.com/jayai2014/monty_hall/blob/master/main.py), I have the following output:

```
AVERAGE: Winning rate = 0.334 for keeping choice.
AVERAGE: Winning rate = 0.666 for switching choice.
```
